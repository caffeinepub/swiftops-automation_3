The visualization must show connected workflow nodes with an AI processing hub at the center, displaying a flow: CRM → AI Agent → Chatbot → Email → Analytics → Apps. Include floating dashboard panels with glassmorphism styling, neural network connection lines, and real-time performance indicators. Preserve all existing text, progress bar, and layout unchanged.",
