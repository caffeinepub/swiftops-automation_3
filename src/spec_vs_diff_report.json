  "summary": "The diff shows comprehensive implementation of button animations and Integrations section enhancements. Button animations were added to CSS with smooth transitions, hover scaling to 1.05, active scaling to 0.96, cubic-bezier timing functions, and GPU-accelerated transforms. The Integrations section received viewport-triggered fade-in animations (translateY 30px to 0 over 0.7s), staggered card animations with 0.1s delays, scale effects (0.95 to 1), floating icon animations, and animated gradient backgrounds. Smooth scrolling was enabled globally. Mobile optimizations appear to rely on CSS media queries that may be present but truncated. While most requirements are addressed, evidence for mobile-specific button touch optimization (REQ-8) and explicit mobile animation intensity reduction (REQ-15) is limited in the visible diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Ensure buttons on mobile respond instantly to touch with no delay after tap and maintain smooth animation timing",
      "reason": "The diff shows touch-action: manipulation added to button classes which helps prevent 300ms tap delay, but explicit verification of instant touch response and consistent animation timing on mobile devices is not clearly evident in the visible code",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Reduce animation intensity on mobile devices for the Integrations section while maintaining smooth appearance without lag",
      "reason": "While the IntegrationsSection.tsx shows conditional animation classes (md:animate-integration-float), explicit evidence of reduced animation intensity or performance optimizations specifically for mobile viewports in the Integrations section is not clearly visible in the truncated diff",
