  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of the robotic eagle logo replacement and animation system. REQ-1 (image generation) cannot be verified from code changes alone. REQ-2 through REQ-5 show detailed implementation with activation animations, hover effects, and mobile optimization. No hallucinated features detected beyond the spec.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Generate a high-detail futuristic robotic eagle head image with metallic robotic structure, AI machine-style face panels, mechanical feather segments, sharp aggressive beak design, glowing neon cyan energy lines, subtle circuit patterns or tech engravings, futuristic armor plating look, symmetrical professional design, and premium startup branding quality",
      "reason": "Image generation is not a code change that appears in diffs. The component references '/assets/generated/robotic-eagle-logo.dim_512x512.png' but the actual image file generation/creation process is not visible in the code changes shown. This requirement likely involves external image generation tools or manual asset creation.",
