  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers all 7 core requirements. The AI workflow visualization replaces the static image with animated canvas-based graphics showing connected nodes, flowing particles, pulsing paths, and floating glassmorphism panels. The custom neon cursor system includes desktop cursor with trail/glow effects, hover interactions with magnetic attraction and expansion, mobile touch ripples and scroll orbs, performance detection for low-end devices, and GPU-accelerated animations. All styling matches the neon futuristic theme with proper colors and effects. The diff shows comprehensive implementation across new components (AIWorkflowVisualization, NeonCursor, TouchGlowEffect, usePerformanceDetection) and proper integration into existing files.",
