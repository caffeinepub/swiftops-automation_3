  "summary": "The diff implements all seven requirements for the eagle logo animation with head-activated neon glow. The implementation includes the head-first power-on animation, three-layer neon glow system visible from the first frame, energy spread effect, light bloom burst, shimmer sweep, breathing pulse, and GPU-accelerated animations. All requirements appear to be satisfied based on the available evidence.",
