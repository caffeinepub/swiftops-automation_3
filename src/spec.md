# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix navigation menu linking, remove Projects button, and enhance the eagle logo with electric blue neon glow animations and smooth entry effects.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix About and Contact navigation buttons to scroll correctly to their respective sections with smooth scrolling
- Verify all sections have correct unique IDs (home, services, about, contact)
- Update Navbar component links to use correct hash anchors
- Remove Projects button completely from desktop navigation, mobile menu, and all routing configuration
- Add electric blue neon glow effect to eagle logo with continuous gentle pulse animation
- Add smooth light shimmer animation moving across the eagle logo every 3-4 seconds
- Add hover interaction that increases glow intensity, scales logo to 1.05x, and spreads glow outward
- Implement smooth entry animation on page load with fade, scale from 0.85 to normal, and soft upward motion
- Add neon glow activation effect where glow powers on gradually over 1-1.5 seconds, spreading from center to edges
- Optimize all animations using GPU-accelerated CSS for smooth mobile performance

**User-visible outcome:** Navigation menu buttons work correctly to scroll to their sections, the Projects button is removed, and the eagle logo displays premium electric blue neon glow effects with smooth pulsing, shimmer animations, hover interactions, and an impressive entry animation on page load.
