# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the static AI Performance section image with an animated workflow visualization and add a premium neon cursor effect across the entire website.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the image in AI-Driven Performance Intelligence section with an animated AI workflow hub visualization showing CRM → AI Agent → Chatbot → Email → Analytics → Apps flow
- Add animated data lines, pulsing connections, floating dashboard panels, particles, and glow effects to the visualization
- Style visualization with Neon Blue, Electric Cyan, and Soft Purple colors on dark gradient background with premium SaaS aesthetic
- Implement depth parallax effect on scroll for the visualization
- Create custom neon blue cursor for desktop with glow halo, trailing light effect, and lag-follow motion
- Add hover interactions: cursor expansion, glow intensification, magnetic attraction, and pulse animations on interactive elements
- Implement touch glow effects for mobile: ripple pulses at tap points and subtle floating orb during scrolling
- Apply GPU-accelerated 60fps animations with automatic performance optimization and accessibility features

**User-visible outcome:** The AI Performance section displays a sophisticated animated workflow visualization instead of a static image, and the entire website features an elegant neon cursor on desktop and touch glow effects on mobile that enhance the futuristic AI theme.
