# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Increase the Gmail contact card size while keeping the email address on a single line.

**Planned changes:**
- Increase font size and dimensions of the Gmail contact card in the ContactSection component
- Ensure the email address displays on one line without wrapping or overflow
- Maintain proper spacing and alignment with other contact cards

**User-visible outcome:** The Gmail contact card displays larger and more prominently while the email address remains cleanly formatted on a single line.
